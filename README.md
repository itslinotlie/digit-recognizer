# Digit Recognizer

With a quick glance, it is easy to identify this image as a pizzaâ€”for the ~~cultured~~ sensible ones at the very least. We are able to do this with the help of 85+ billion neurons located in our brain, which help transmit and communicate information across different areas of the brain. Image recognition is something we never think twice about, but how would a computer recognize this image?

Our vast system of intertwined neurons is the inspiration for the widely used machine learning technique called *Artifical Neural Networks (ANN)*, the technique which builds upon the foundation for computer vision.

After learning the theory of backtracking and itching to code a small-scale project, I decided to set foot into creating a Sudoku solver from sractch, completely underestimating the complexitiy of optical character recognition (OCR), the technology used to recognize text inside images.

This project will be the first half of the Sudoku project and will document my journey through the process of understanding neural networks, deriving the backpropagation algorithm, and training my model through the MNIST digit database.
